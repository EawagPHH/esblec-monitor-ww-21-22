# ESBL-_E. coli_ monitoring in WW
## code 
### analyses.R 
The analyses.R file that allows to reproduce all the figures, tables and statistical tests within the main manuscript and within the supplementary material. 

The code is subdivided in 7 main chapters:
1. Calculate overall statistics of _E. coli_ ecoli_counts
2. Investigate differences between wastewater treatment plants
    - Plots
    - Statistical tests
3. Investigate differences between months
    - Plots
    - Statistical tests
4. Investigate correlations with environmental variables
5. Estimate the sample size
6. Estimate carriage of ESBL-_E. coli_
7. Analyze distribution of intestinal carriage data in Bangladesh

In order to run the whole code, it is essential to:
- install and load the required packages running the lines 2:22
- format the df running the lines 23:132

The working directory is set three times and needs to be changed depending on the user:
- line 25: setwd where **ecoli_counts.csv** is stored
- line 963: setwd where **DBDA2E-utilities.R** file is stored
- line 2708: setwd where **intestinal_carriage_bangladesh.csv** is stored

### DBDA2E-utilities.R 
The DBDA2E-utilities.R file contains the packages required to estimate the sample size using Bayesian inference. The statistics use the package rjags, which work properly on windows systems, but not necessarily on MacOS. 

The file is called by the main code file analyses.R if stored in the correct working directory. 

## data
### ecoli_counts.csv
The file ecoli_counts.csv contains all the data necessarity to run the first 6 chapters of the analyses.R code (all except the analyses of the intestinal carriage in Bangladesh). 

Variables in the data file (_na_ indicates that data are not available for that observation and/or that variable):
- **date**: dd_mm_yyyy
- **wwtp**: wastewater treatment plant (Altenrhein, Chur, Geneva, Laupen, Lugano)
- **capacity**: number of inhabitants connected to the wastewater treatment plant
- **temperature**: air temperature data at a height of 2 meters above ground, with a daily average from 6 UTC to 18 UTC (Â°C)
- **precipitation_96h_sum_mm**: cumulative sum of precipitation over 96 hours leading up to and including the wastewater collection day
- **precipitations_24h_sum_mm**: daily total precipitations from 0 UTC to 0 UTC on the wastewater collection day
- **totalEc_cfu_100ml_a**: number of colony forming units of total _E. coli_ counted in 100mL of wastewater, non-adjusted by flowrate (Replicate 1)
- **totalEc_cfu_100ml_b**: number of colony forming units of total _E. coli_ counted in 100mL of wastewater, non-adjusted by flowrate (Replicate 2)
- **esblEc_cfu_100ml_a**: number of colony forming units of ESBL-_E. coli_ counted in 100mL of wastewater, non-adjusted by flowrate (Replicate 1)
- **esblEc_cfu_100ml_2**: number of colony forming units of ESBL-_E. coli_ counted in 100mL of wastewater, non-adjusted by flowrate (Replicate 2)
- **esblEc_percentage_a**: esblEc_cfu_100ml_a/totalEc_cfu_100ml_a*100 (Replicate 1)
- **esblEc_percentage_b**: esblEc_cfu_100ml_b/totalEc_cfu_100ml_b*100 (Replicate 2)
- **flowrate_m3_day**: flow rate of the wwtp on the sampling day (as cubic meters per day)
- **totalEc_loads_a**: loads of total _E. coli_ expressed as colony forming units per day and per person, the totalEc_cfu_100ml_a variable was normalized by the flowrate and the number of inhabitants in the wwtp (Replicate 1)
- **totalEc_loads_b**: loads of total _E. coli_ expressed as colony forming units per day and per person, the totalEc_cfu_100ml_b variable was normalized by the flowrate and the number of inhabitants in the wwtp (Replicate 2)
- **esblEc_loads_a**: loads of ESBL-_E. coli_ expressed as colony forming units per day and per person, the esblEc_cfu_100ml_a variable was normalized by the flowrate and the number of inhabitants in the wwtp (Replicate 1) 
- **esblEc_loads_b**: loads of ESBL-_E. coli_ expressed as colony forming units per day and per person, the esblEc_cfu_100ml_b variable was normalized by the flowrate and the number of inhabitants in the wwtp (Replicate 2)

### intestinal_carriage_bangladesh.csv
The file intestinal_carriage_bangladesh.csv includes the data of ESBL-_E. coli_ relative to total _E. coli_ in 67 children from Bangladesh, and have been retrieved by a cohort study conducted by Montealegre et _al.,_ 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11359).

Variables in the data file:
- **child_id**: number assigned to the children (1:67)
- **totEcoli_CFUs_gram_feces**: number of colony forming units of total _E. coli_ detected in 1 gram of feces 
- **esblEcoli_CFUs_gram_feces**: number of colony forming units of ESBL-_E. coli_ detected in 1 gram of feces
- **percentage_esblEc**: esblEcoli_CFUs_gram_feces/totEcoli_CFUs_gram_feces*100
